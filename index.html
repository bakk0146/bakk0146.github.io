  <h1>Why ICT fits me</h1>

  <!-- Paragraph 1: motivation -->
  <p>
    What excites me about ICT is being able to be creative while solving problems. As in my Who am I reflection, you can see that I like being able to make my own moves while working on something creative and technical. I want to build a strong foundation so I can explore different directions in the future, and HBO-ICT is amazing for that.
  </p>

  <!-- Paragraph 2: why this study fits -->
  <p>
    ICT feels like the right fit because I’ve always been interested in technology and computers, even from a young age. While I haven’t focused much on coding or programming yet, I'm definitely curious about it and since I like being creative and solving problems, it's only right to try it out next. Also in high school 'informatica' which is very similar always to ICT, was my favorite subject, it only makes sense to choose this!
  </p>

  <!-- Proof -->
  <p>
    Proof I’m serious: I’ve started building this site and I’m improving it based on feedback. The subject 'informatica' in high school was the one I always scored the highest in, which is similar to ICT. On top of that, I take working out very serious, and that work ethic will definitely carry over to this.
  </p>

  <!-- List: reasons it suits you -->
  <h3>Top reasons ICT suits me</h3>
  <ul class="reasons">
    <li>Curiosity: I've always had an interest for technology.</li>
    <li>Creativity: I love being to use my creativity, which undoubtedly will be used here.</li>
    <li>Problem-solving: It feels like a game to me.</li>
    <li>Future opportunities: ICT opens doors to many fields — from software development to security, AI, you name it.</li>
